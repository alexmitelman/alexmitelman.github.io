      <description>I came across the word &amp;ldquo;exabyte&amp;rdquo; three times in just one today. Previously I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know this word exists. So 1 exabyte is 1,000 petabytes, or 1 exabyte is 1,000,000 terabytes. Companies operate at a scale of millions of terabytes now.
&amp;ldquo;Apple is apparently Google’s largest customer now, followed by ByteDance (parent company of the TikTok app). Apple holds 8 exabytes of data with Google Cloud, ByteDance is in the region of 500 petabytes — 16x less.</description>

      <description>Highlights GitHub: How we scaled the API with a sharded, replicated rate limiter in Redis GitHub API has a limit on API calls per key. Such keys were stored in Memcached along with their reset_at value and number of calls. Memcached was also used for application caching purposes.
Such a solution works well but harder to scale. It was decided to have one Memcached per datacenter, in which case clients can face some issues if requests hit different datacenters.</description>
