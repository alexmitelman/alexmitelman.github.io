      <description>Highlights Kiwi.com: Nonstop Operations with Scylla Even Through the OVHcloud Fire Fire on French OVHcloud affected four datacenters: SBG2 was destroyed, SBG1 adjacent rooms were partially on fire, SBG3 and SBG4 were switched off to fight the fire. Overall, 3.6 million websites were affected, including banks and mail servers.
Kiwi.com uses Scylla - NoSQL database, as a highly available and resilient solution. Their monitoring system detected spikes as nodes went down but later other OVHcloud datacenters took over the requests.</description>

In addition DNS over TLS is also a factor. They use Unbound as a DNS resolver. For a better failover, they set 30 seconds TTL for such responses.
There are two options to solve this problem. The first is prefetching. This means that on each request TTL is checked.</description>
