      <description>Highlights HashiCorp State of Cloud Strategy Survey HahiCorp surveyed 3200+ decision-makers from their contact database. Here are key takeaways:
 76% of the companies are already multi-cloud. 86% plan to be multi-cloud in two years. 90% of large corporations adopt multi-cloud solutions while only 60% of startups moved towards this direction. Digital transformation is the main multi-cloud driver. Other reasons are avoiding single cloud vendor lock, cost reduction, and scaling. Service mesh adoption is expected to grow 2.</description>

      <description>Highlights Logging at Twitter: Updated Centralized logging at Twitter was limited by low ingestion capacity and query capabilities which resulted in poor adoption. The previous solution ingested around 600K events per second per data center. However, only around 10% of the logs were submitted, with the remaining 90% discarded by the rate limiter. To address this, Twitter adopted Splunk Enterprise and migrated centralized logging to it. Now it ingests 4 times more logging data and has a better query engine and better user adoption.</description>

      <description>Highlights How WhatsApp enables multi-device capability WhatsApp phone client was previously a source of truth. If someone wanted to use WhatsApp on another device, the messages would be transferred through the smartphone app. If the smartphone battery was drained, such a companion app would not be able to work. The smartphone kept the data.
WhatsApp now allows connecting 4 additional devices that are independent of the smartphone. Each device gets an identity key.</description>

      <description>Highlights DoorDash: Building Faster Indexing with Apache Kafka and Elasticsearch The DoorDash team faced an issue of a very long time for updating the search index. They&amp;rsquo;ve built a search system relying on open source technologies. It uses Kafka as a message queue and for data storage, Flink for data transformation, and sending data to Elasticsearch. A reliable indexing system would ensure that changes in stores and items are reflected in the search index in real-time.</description>

      <description>Highlights Managing Asynchronous Workflows with a REST API Building a REST API, sometimes there is a need to run some complicated logic that takes some time. In these cases, the REST call sparks an asynchronous job.
For example, a call to generate a PDF report: POST /api/v1/report. In response, REST API answers with status HTTP/1.1 201 Created and a Location header to get the result Location: /api/v1/report/123.
What are the options to fetch the result of this asynchronous job?</description>

      <description>I came across the word &amp;ldquo;exabyte&amp;rdquo; three times in just one today. Previously I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know this word exists. So 1 exabyte is 1,000 petabytes, or 1 exabyte is 1,000,000 terabytes. Companies operate at a scale of millions of terabytes now.
&amp;ldquo;Apple is apparently Google’s largest customer now, followed by ByteDance (parent company of the TikTok app). Apple holds 8 exabytes of data with Google Cloud, ByteDance is in the region of 500 petabytes — 16x less.</description>

      <description>Highlights Learn how Dream11, the World’s largest fantasy sports platform, scale their social network with Amazon Neptune and Amazon ElastiCache Dream11 is a fantasy sports platform that has social network features. The team evaluated different graph database solutions for the social network service and chose Amazon Neptune after a load/stress PoC. Dream11 is already operating within AWS infrastructure so including a fully managed graph DB into the VPC was one of the factors.</description>

      <description>Highlights Uber: Handling Flaky Unit Tests in Java While the headline mentions Java, this experience is language-agnostic and can be helpful with any other programming language.
Uber team has moved all their repositories to a single monolithic repository. This move helps to better manage dependencies, testing infrastructure, build systems, static analysis tooling. Although individual repos had stable tests, after merging to a monorepo there were lots of flaky tests. Why did it happen?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve received incredible feedback on my last week&amp;rsquo;s blog post Amazon API Gateway with Lambda is the Next Generation of Web Frameworks.
As Adrian Mace suggested, there is a new Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool from Amazon, called AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit). I missed this awesome tool. To quote Adrian:
 &amp;ldquo;CDK allows you to define your infrastructure using imperative languages like TypeScript, Python, or Golang with the full powers that those languages can provide, and then ‘compiles down’ into Cloudformation templates upon deploy/synth.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve migrated my website from GitHub Pages to Cloudflare Pages. I&amp;rsquo;ve also moved my domain from Namecheap to Cloudflare. I have already used Cloudflare Web Analytics instead of Google Analytics. The reasoning behind this is following:
Cloudflare Web Analytics. I didn&amp;rsquo;t like the idea of Google tracking my website visitors. Google Analytics sets a cookie. This probably means that such sites need to put that annoying cookie disclaimer that the EU came up with (out of good intentions, of course).</description>

      <description>A short history of web frameworks What is a web framework? A web framework is a set of tools for the rapid development of server-side applications that provides a boilerplate to simplify the implementation of common tasks. According to MDN, those tasks are routing URLs to appropriate handlers, interacting with databases, supporting sessions and user authorization, formatting output (e.g. HTML, JSON, XML), and improving security against web attacks. The most popular web frameworks are Ruby on Rails, Django, Flask, FastAPI, Express, Laravel.</description>

      <description>Highlights Pinterest: Shallow Mirror Kafka MirrorMaker is a tool to replicate Kafka clusters across different regions. Data from different Source Brokers is transferred to MirrorMaker which then sends this data to Destination Brokers in other regions. Pinterest started experiencing scalability issues at some point.
Monitoring showed some CPU and memory spikes. During the investigation, it became apparent that most of the CPU time was spent on message decompression and recompression. Memory consumption was often 2-10 times bigger than the actual data being sent.</description>

      <description>Highlights AWS: Diving Deep on S3 Consistency Werner Vogels, CTO at Amazon, shares the journey of building strong consistency for AWS S3. When S3 was launched 15 years ago in 2006, it was simple storage for files, backups, etc. The eventual consistency model was more than enough for such purposes. This means that sometimes API would return an older version of the object that was not yet propagated through the nodes.</description>

      <description>Highlights Instacart: Don’t let the crows guide your routes Instacart connects shoppers to make purchases and deliver them to the app customers. To make it more efficient, the application should calculate optimal routes to make purchases and deliver orders.
The easiest and the most naïve solution to calculate the path between two dots on a map is to calculate Haversine Distance - a straight line between two dots, similar to a bird flying between them.</description>

      <description>Highlights DoorDash: Optimizing OpenTelemetry’s Span Processor for High Throughput and Low CPU Costs With an effort to migrate from the monolith to microservices, there is a need to trace requests between these services. OpenTelemetry is a new project aiming to become a standard. As a request hits a system, OpenTelemetry assigns a unique ID, all the underlying services (called spans) receive the same ID. Spans data is being collected on a local collector, then it&amp;rsquo;s sent to a collector gateway.</description>

      <description>Highlights FullContact: Improving the Graph: Transition to ScyllaDB FullContact set an ambitious goal of 10,000 QPS. Initially, they moved their database from HBase to Cassandra. Cluster consisted of 3 instances of c5.2xlarge EC2 + 2 TB of gp2 EBS storage. With the growing amount of records in the database, response time crept from 100 ms to 300 ms. It turned out that the default Size Tiered Compaction Strategy is optimized for inserts which lead to a single file for SSTable.</description>

      <description>Highlights GitHub: How we scaled the API with a sharded, replicated rate limiter in Redis GitHub API has a limit on API calls per key. Such keys were stored in Memcached along with their reset_at value and number of calls. Memcached was also used for application caching purposes.
Such a solution works well but harder to scale. It was decided to have one Memcached per datacenter, in which case clients can face some issues if requests hit different datacenters.</description>

      <description>Highlights Kiwi.com: Nonstop Operations with Scylla Even Through the OVHcloud Fire Fire on French OVHcloud affected four datacenters: SBG2 was destroyed, SBG1 adjacent rooms were partially on fire, SBG3 and SBG4 were switched off to fight the fire. Overall, 3.6 million websites were affected, including banks and mail servers.
Kiwi.com uses Scylla - NoSQL database, as a highly available and resilient solution. Their monitoring system detected spikes as nodes went down but later other OVHcloud datacenters took over the requests.</description>

      <description>Highlights Aurora: Payment Acquiring Solution with CockroachDB on Kubernetes Aurora is the company that handles credit card payments. Such transactions should work all the time, be consistent and scalable. That&amp;rsquo;s why they migrate from PostgreSQL to CockroachDB: eventual consistency is not an option in this business. CockroachDB guarantees serializable transactions. This blog post describes higher level architecture of the solution. Tech stack: .NET Core C#, ReactJS, CockroachDB.
Key takeaways. Hybryd-Cloud: Google Cloud + 2 co-location, never be 100% cloud or 100% private, hence no vendor lock, better availability if certain cloud provider goes down.</description>

      <description>Highlights Slack: Migrating Millions of Concurrent Websockets to Envoy Slack makes an extensive use of websocket technology for their messaging service. Historically, they used HAProxy as a load balance, however, they faced an issue with dynamic updates of a list of endpoints. They could also change config and restart a load balancer which is tricky as it has to maintain existing websocket connections.
They&amp;rsquo;ve decided to switch to Envoy proxy as it allows dynamic change of the configuration.</description>

      <description>Highlights Cloudflare: The benefits of serving stale DNS entries when using Consul Cloudflare faced an issue with long latencies for DNS responses in certain parts of the world. In addition DNS over TLS is also a factor. They use Unbound as a DNS resolver. For a better failover, they set 30 seconds TTL for such responses.
There are two options to solve this problem. The first is prefetching. This means that on each request TTL is checked.</description>

      <description>Highlights Reddit: Scaling Reporting Reddit had an ad analytics system that aggregated data per ad ID and per day. This data was stored in Redis as a Thrift object. This works well if an advertiser wants to see analytics for a given day. However, looking up stats per range of dates means that application had to get every value for every date in the range of dates, deserialize Thrift dictionaries, which is also a CPU intensive operation.</description>

      <description>Intro The goal of this tutorial is to describe Python development ecosystem. It can be helpful for someone coming to Python from another programming language.
They say that you should stick to algorithms and data structures, that you can learn a new language in just a couple of weeks, that it&amp;rsquo;s just a new syntax. I completely agree that algorithms and data structures are extremely important but when it comes to language it&amp;rsquo;s slightly more than just syntax.</description>
